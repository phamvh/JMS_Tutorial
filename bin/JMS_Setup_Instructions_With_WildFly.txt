This project runs on WildFly 9 (aka JBoss).

Instruction to set up WildFly:

1. Download WildFly 9 (Instructions may be different for other versions, older or newer).
2. Open file wildfly-9.0.2.Final/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml and modify it as follow:

2.1 Look for the xml tag <hornetQ-server>
2.2 Inside this one, you can add any queue or topic as you want. There are already some sample queue and topic in there.
   You can add a new one to the <jms-destinations>, like this:
      <jms-topic name="test1Topic">
            <entry name="topic/test1"/>
            <entry name="java:jboss/exported/jms/topic/test1"/>
      </jms-topic>
      
2.3 (This is found by pandush, not sure whether this is necessary or not, but he had to do it to make it work.)
  Comment out the <security-settings> tag, and next to it, add <security-enabled>false<security-enabled>, like below:
  
     <security-enabled>false</security-enabled>
     <!--security-settings>
                    <security-setting match="#">
                        <permission type="send" roles="guest"/>
                        <permission type="consume" roles="guest"/>
                        <permission type="createNonDurableQueue" roles="guest"/>
                        <permission type="deleteNonDurableQueue" roles="guest"/>
                    </security-setting>
     </security-settings-->  
 To me, it seems like if you add a user and password with correct rights, then you won't need to comment out this security settings. 
 
 2.4 Make sure to start the wildfly with the option that indicates the standalone-full.xml file. There are two ways, from command line or in eclipse:
    - From command line, enter: ./standalone.sh --server-config=standalone-full.xml
    - If you start WildFly inside Eclipse, Eclipse has an option to provide the configuration file during the set-up of the server. Make sure to specify it.   
 2.5 That's it for the setup. For the project, make sure to enter the correct info for the queue or topic in the jndi.properties file. This info is taken from the standalone-full.xml.
   Note that if you don't want to create this file, you can just create a Properties instance inside your code, and pass it to the constructor of InitialContext.
